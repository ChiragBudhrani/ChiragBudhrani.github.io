                <h1>Chapter 1: Don&#39;t make me think!</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    It is the first rule for website design &quot;Don&#39;t make me think!&quot;. The user should
                    completely
                    understand what a website is about and how to navigate through it. A web page should be
                    obvious and self-explanatory. Krug says as a developer it&#39;s your job to get rid of questions.
                    If it is hard to make a web site clearly evident one should at least try to make it self-
                    explanatory.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Things that make us think:</strong>
               
                    <br>
                    Few things can always raise a question in user&#39;s mind like, the naming convention of the
                    website elements, what must be the input etc.
                    <br>
                    While logging into a website if button text is changed from login to initialize then the user
                    will surely think what will be the result if one clicks initialize button.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="2">
                <h1>chapter 2: How we really use the Web</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    There is a significant difference how the developer things user will browse the page and how the
                    user will actually browse it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>We don't read pages we scan them:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The author says that user will be always in hurry and will not read each and every content on the
                    page. One will scan the web page and will see if there is something one is interested in. If the
                    user finds it one will select it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>We don't make optimal choices. We satisfy:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The user won't select the option which is best for one but will select the first option which will
                    provide a solution to him and is reasonable even if it is a bit cumbersome.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through:</strong>
                    <br>
                    The user will always create his explanation about the web page instead of figuring out completely
                    what it is actually for. For example, one will convert word file to pdf by using a website because
                    that is the first solution which made him sense and will stick to it until he finds other option
                    which he can muddle.

                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="3">
                <h1>Chapter 3: Billboard Design 101</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    As the user is always scanning the web page following are the things to keep in mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Conventions are your friends</strong>
                    <br>
                    Use the web page conventions as any user will be expecting things in that manner.
                    <br>
                    The user will assume that the logo will be placed on the top left corner of the web page. If there
                    is a search bar it will be on the top right corner. For example, play icon in any video streaming
                    website will be same.
                    <br>
                    One can opt not to use web conventions if it is self-explanatory and obvious or it adds enough value
                    to spent some time and figure out.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Create effective visual hierarchies</strong>
                    <br>
                    More important things should be more eye-catching. The most important thing is large in size,
                    surrounded by white spaces, near to the top of image etc.
                    <br>
                    Things that are connected should be related visually by giving them same visual style and grouping
                    them together under one heading. For example, in an e-commerce website all products related to
                    workout will be displayed under workout section on the left menu.
                    <br>
                    Pages should be divided into clearly defined areas. All the elements which are clickable should be
                    easily recognized and obvious.
                    <br>
                    Cursor shape should change from an arrow to hand when one is hovering a link. The color of the links
                    should distinct visited and unvisited links.
                    <br>
                    When each and every element of the webpage clamor one's attention it is termed as shouting. Some
                    pages are disorganized and the elements of the page look like a room where everything is strewn.
                    When a homepage contains a lot of stuff it is termed as clutter. All the three are termed as noise
                    as they reduce the interest of the user and are cumbersome to understand.

                <h1>Chapter 4: Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    The author of this chapter tells that it is not necessary how many clicks take a user to the
                    destination one is looking for until it is a mindless choice. A user believes that each click will
                    take one closer to the solution. He terms that "three mindless clicks are equal to one click".

                <hr>
                <div>
                    A user scans through the website. so unnecessary things like happy talk i.e. an introductory text
                    which thanks the user for visiting their website or promotions and instructions must not be used.
                    There should not be any instruction instead site should be self-explanatory.

                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="6">
                <h1>Chapter 6: Street signs and Breadcrumbs</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    A user will navigate on the website as one strolls in a physical store when one is looking for a
                    product. The user will browse the site by following the hierarchy and using signs to guide one. User
                    leaves the site if one does not find what one is looking for.
                    <br>
                    A user never remembers what path one has followed so when a user wants to revert back one mostly
                    clicks the back button. Statistics show that back button accounts for 30%-40% of total web button
                    clicks.
                    <br>
                    The purpose of navigation is to provide an idea in which page the user currently is and it also
                    helps the user to understand where to look for the desired information. Navigation helps the user to
                    understand how to use the site.
                    <br>
                    The developers use a global design for the entire website. This ensures the users that they are on
                    the same site. Deciding the site logo or ID is as good as naming a site as it represents the entire
                    site.
                    <br>
                    The links to the main section of the site are always placed on the global design section. These
                    links are also termed as primary navigation. By this a user can know which links are important, it
                    reminds where he currently is.
                    <br>
                    Utility links are important elements of the site but are not the part of the content hierarchy.
                    Contact information is a good example of a utility link. Every page name must be prominent and it
                    must suit with a link the user has clicked.
                    <br>
                    It is nice if breadcrumbs are left on the top of the page separated by '>' show the user where he
                    currently is. The last element should be the current page and should be in bold.
                    <br>
                    The author says he loves the use of tabs in the website as they are self-evident, rarely missed by
                    someone and correct use of it can make a web page visually interesting.

                </div>

                <h1>Chapter 7: The Big Bang Theory of Web Design</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    One page which will have most importance is the home page. The homepage will be the one which will
                    be seen and visited by all the potential users. Due to this every designer and stakeholder wants
                    something of their on the home page. With this "Too many cooks spoil the broth" situation occurs.
                    <br>
                    The homepage should consist of site identity and mission, hierarchy, a search box (if required),
                    promotion of the content like some new offers, the link of the newly added features, new deals,
                    shortcuts to few links, registration link, and content which is up to date with time.
                    <br>
                    Two important things which give information about the site are tagline and welcome blurb. A tagline
                    is placed near the site ID which gives an idea of the site in few words. A welcome blurb is a brief
                    description, which is displayed in the prominent bock of the webpage and does not require any
                    scrolling.
                    <br>
                    When a user visits the home page it should be clear for one where to start if one wants to search,
                    browse or to see the best stuff.

                    The web designers cannot be helpful for deciding the usability questions as they are the one who
                    loves designing things and love making things visually pleasing. So it is difficult for them to
                    think o a layman and decide the usability questions.
                    <br>
                    A designer is also a web user, so one should think of the same way how one feels about the website.
                    By this, they can get the idea what a novice user will think of their website.
                    <br>
                    One has to utilize experience, collective skill, creativity and common sense to create a website.
                    These things should also be considered while creating a crude version of the website.

                <h1>Chapter 9: Usability Testing on 10 cents a day</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    Here the author defines how a â€˜do it yourself testingâ€™ should be done.
                    <br>
                    
                    <strong>Focus groups are not usability testing:</strong>
                    <br>
                    In focus groups, a small group of people gather together and discuss the product, their past
                    experience or their reaction to a new concept. It is best for determining what a user demands and
                    how the user wants it. It is best for the planning stage of the project.
                    <br>
                    While, usability testing is when a person tries to use the prototype, website or new design and to
                    observe things which frustrates the user.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Several true things about usability testing:</strong>
                    <br>
                    To develop a good site it is necessary to test it. Once a developer has worked on a site for few
                    days one cannot see it as a layman.
                    Usability testing done by a person is better than not having a usability testing at all. By this one
                    can know where there are flaws in the website.
                    Testing done by a single user at an early stage is better than usability testing done by many at the
                    end. It will help to find the errors on the website and it will be easy and cost-effective for the
                    developer to do changes early.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How often you should test?</strong><br>
                    Testing should at least be done once a month. This will just take few minutes and one can know about
                    the bugs in the code early. One more advantage is that when testing other team members will also
                    watch how a user will read the site.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   
                    <strong>How many users do you need?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Ideally one will require a minimum of three users as the aim of this usability testing is to find
                    out serious usability problems and fix them. This will only improve the quality of the website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How do you Choose the participants?</strong><br>
                    One should keep in mind the target audience but can recruit the participants who are not from the
                    target domain because at an early stage of the project it wonâ€™t be necessary to recruit target
                    audience. A website should be such that even a novice user can use it.<br>
                    <strong>What do you test, and when do you test it?</strong><br>
                    The author says it is never to early to start testing. One can test the competitive websites before
                    starting the designing by which one can know about the flaws in the competition and can be
                    beneficial.<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How do you choose the task to test?</strong><br>
                    For each round of testing choose the task which one wants the participants to test. Then explain it
                    to the participants and give them enough time to complete the task and take their feedback.<br>
                    <br><strong>What Happens in the test?</strong><br>
                    First, welcome the participants and ask questions about them this will help to understand the user.
                    Give them a tour of the home page.
                    Explain them regarding the task and conduct the test.
                    Ask the question regarding the task after the user completes the task and pay them.
                    <br><br><strong>Typical problems:</strong><br>
                    The typical problems which a participant will face are:
                    They are unclear about the idea of the website.
                    They are unable to find the words they are used to.
                    There is so much content on the screen that they canâ€™t find what they are looking for.In short they
                    cannot scan the website properly.
                    <br><br><strong>Debriefing:</strong><br>
                    After the usability test, create a list of serious problems, rate them in worst to good and create a
                    checklist which will consist of problems to be resolved.

                <h1>Chapter 10: Mobile: Itâ€™s not just a city in Alabama anymore</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    Not much difference between mobile and web application. Only one thing user scans the website
                    faster.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>The tyranny of itty-bitty living space:</strong>
                    <br>
                    Mobile phones have small living space/ screen so many tradeoffs must be made in deciding which
                    features should be included. One approach is to follow mobile first approach i.e. to include the
                    features which are most necessary for the user instead of providing all the information.
                    The mobile website can be deep as compared to the desktop version. A user might have to tap few
                    times to get to some features.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                    Breeding Chameleons
                    </strong><br>
                    The website should have following options
                    Allow Zooming: If the there website does not have mobile version it can provide zoom feature so that
                    the user can zoom and see the content one is searching for.
                    Provide link: Link to desktop version should be provided so that the user can access it.
                    <br><br><strong>Donâ€™t Hide affordance:</strong><br>
                    Donâ€™t hide affordance, as it provides visual clues to the user how the element can be used. For
                    example, a button with a three-dimensional style points that it is clickable and will result in some
                    reaction when it is clicked.
                    <br><br><strong>No cursor/ No hover/ no clue:</strong><br>
                    As the cursor is not available on the mobile screens the features of hovering like getting a
                    tooltip, buttons which change shape or color on hover are not available. So the developer has to
                    come up with the ideas to replace them.
                    <br><br><strong>You actually can be too rich or too thin:</strong><br>
                    In mobile devices speed in which it responds is everything so the website must be thin in content so
                    that it does not take time to load and the user is not frustrated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Delightful is the new black:</strong>
                    <br>
                    By delightful author means something that the user has would love to do but has never imagined.
                    Building a delightful app gives one edge over other competitors in the market. Making an app
                    delightful is secondary task primary task is to make it usable.
                    <br><br><strong>Apps need to be learnable:</strong><br>
                    The application should be self-explanatory and one more important thing is that it should be clear
                    why the application is built and it should only have those features. A small tutorial at the
                    beginning of application when the app is launch first time is really helpful.
                    <br><br><strong>Apps need to be memorable too:</strong><br>
                    The application must be designed in such a way that it is easier for the user to remember how to
                    operate it. One way to achieve it to make an app easily learnable.
                    <br><br><strong>Mobile testing:</strong><br>
                    Mobile application testing is done in the same way as it is done for the website. The only
                    difference is that it is hard to do usability testing of the mobile application than a website.
                    Software like a robust screen recording application is not available for a mobile device as it does
                    not allow any process in the background.
                    one way to test the mobile application is to mount a camera on the mobile device when the
                    participant is using the application so that participant can hold the mobile naturally and one can
                    also record the hand gestures and what is happening on the screen.

                <hr>
                <div>
                    The author says that a site should be considerate of being clear. No one knows that when a user will
                    get fed up and leave the website and the company if the site is not considerate and provide up to
                    date information.

                    Few things that diminish the goodwill are
                    Hiding information what a user is looking for
                    Asking for some information from the user which is of no use.
                    when the site is not organized.
                    Few things to keep in mind which increase the goodwill are
                    Be aware of the things that the user will be looking for.
                    Create printer-friendly pages.
                    Do not include unnecessary steps.

                <hr>
                <div>
                    A site is never usable until it is made accessible. It is the right thing to do and it also makes
                    the life of people easy. Companies tend to try some validator to check if the website is accessible
                    or not. But validator will produce a result which is mostly not effective.
                    <br>
                    One approach is to fix usability problems which confuse users. For example, people having vision
                    disability scan their website through ears with the help of screen reader. So a link to main content
                    should be provided so that they can move to the main content they are looking for.

                    In this chapter, the author gives advice how to convince their superiors to allow them to have a
                    usability testing. One way is to show them how beneficial will it be for them and convincing them to
                    conduct a demo and ask them to be present in the usability test.
                    <br>
                    One way to convince them is to arrange volunteers for the usability test. Once they see the
                    usability test, they will take interest in it. Another way to make it more interesting is to compare
                    the website with its competition.
