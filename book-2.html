                <h1>Find Usability Problems</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    Usability testing is observing people use your website which one is creating, with the intention to
                    find out that website is easier to use and make it easier to use.

                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="2">
                <h1>Do it Yourself Usability Testing</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    This method is qualitative. The aim of this method is not to prove anything, but just to get
                    insights on the website. Which enables one to improve it.
                    One benefit of this is that it is informal and the protocol can be changed at mid-test.<br>
                    A facilitator always sits with the participant, gives him some task, and encourages one to think out
                    loud. Interested people like a member of development team, stakeholders observe the participant from
                    another room, using screen sharing software.
                    After test session, a debriefing is conducted where they decide what problems should be fixed.<br>

                    Every usability test is useful because every site has problems, most of the problems are easy to
                    find and it gives satisfaction to see someone use what one is designing.
                    <br>
                    A usability test is effective yet many organizations do not conduct it because of reasons like most
                    people still have not had any experience in usability testing, lack of time, and unwillingness to
                    show one's work before it is completed.
                    <br>
                    People avoid usability testing because they think of it as some big production which is referred as
                    Big Honkin' test by the author.
                    <br>
                    The author provides a plan to conduct usability testing once every month and to recruit only three
                    participants and observe them and as testing is done one can move to debriefing and this way in half
                    of the day usability test can be conducted and rest of the month can be spent on correcting only the
                    serious problems.
                    <br>
                    Do it yourself in Agile: There are short cycles in agile methodology. So author suggests conducting
                    a morning a sprint. One can recruit less amount of participants for this and can ask them to test it
                    remotely.
                    <br>
                    Approx budget: Approx budget for " Do it Yourself Usability Testing " is $4000-$6000. Which includes
                    expense for the microphone, screen sharing software, screen recording, and incentives.

                <div>
                    It is good to conduct a test on competitive websites by giving participants task which is given to
                    test one's website. In debriefing team should discuss what features can be applied to own project
                    and what worked well and what not

                <div>
                    When one designs a website one draws some sketch on a piece of paper roughly, and one can ask
                    participants what they understand by showing that rough sketch. This rough sketch is termed by the
                    author as "Sketch on the napkin".

                <div>
                    Wireframes are a schematic diagram of the web page. Testing wireframe can be asking questions about
                    the diagram and finding out what comes on the mid of user when he first views the design and it
                    gives a brief idea of what user expects from the layout and elements.
                    It gives a good idea about the categorization of elements and their naming convention. As it is not
                    time-consuming it should be conducted by testing competitive site.

                <div>
                    It is not necessary that the participants for testing are from the target audience. Specifically for
                    the initial stages. At the end stages also there must be at least one user who is not from the
                    target audience. By this one can find out that what a person will understand seeing the final
                    product at the end stage and how one will react. By this, it will be evident if the site is usable
                    or not.
                    <br>
                    The author advises that there should be 3 participants for usability testing. One benefit is that
                    main problems with the website will be evident by three users. It is also easy to find three
                    participants and one can have more rounds of testing. One easy way is to hire a recruiter but it
                    will surely cost a good amount of money.

                    When a participant does not show up a substitute must be available. A substitute can be any person
                    who is from the other department of the company or a person who is from the other company.
                    <br>
                    A substitute can also be an actual user who can test the website remotely or in person. If the
                    actual user is testing remotely one should be connected constantly till the testing session is
                    completed.

                <hr>
                <div>
                    One should first decide the task one desires to be performed by the user. Then one has to expand the
                    tasks into scenarios i.e. the context the user needs to know for performing the task.
                    <br>
                    One additional task can also be picked up for the users who are quick. Best idea for this is to ask
                    them to perform the same task on the competition's website.
                    <br>
                    Few things to keep in mind while designing the tasks are what is most difficult for the user, things
                    that developer thinks will not be easy for the user, and things what the user research says.

                <hr>
                <div>
                    The scenario is the instructions containing details about the task which are easily understandable
                    and can be easily followed. One more thing is that the words in the scenarios should not be the one
                    which is displayed on the screen.
                    <br>
                    Once scenarios are designed it should be pretested. This is called pilot test. It usually takes
                    about 15 minutes.
                    <br>
                    After this scenario should be printed in two formats. One for the user and it should be taken care
                    that tasks are not numbered. So that an order of tasks can be altered during the test if required.
                    Another format should be for the facilitator so that he can keep the track of which tasks are
                    performed.

                    The facilitator is the person who sits with the participant and encouraged one to think out loud.
                    The facilitator will guide the user about the test and will ask them what they are thinking while
                    performing the test.

                    Before starting a session it should be taken care that the room where a test is to be conducted
                    should have internet access, screen recording software and screens haring software.
                    <br>
                    One should start the session by reading out the script and explain how the test is going to be
                    conducted. There will be pretest and posttest questions, this will be beneficial to make participant
                    comfortable. One should show the home page to the participant and ask them what are they thinking
                    seeing it.
                    <br>
                    Then one will hand the scenario of the task and will read it out. Hand another scenario when
                    participants are done with the first scenario. Always ask them about the clarification of the major
                    problems what they faced after the user has completed the scenario. When done a participant must be
                    paid as promised.

                    testing.
                    <br>
                    To determine the seriousness of the problem things to keep in mind are that will the problem be
                    faced by a lot of users and will it be a problem or just some inconvenience.
                    <br>
                    The person who conducted the test must conduct the debriefing. One should ask everyone to list the
                    most serious problems according to them. Choose ten most serious problems, prioritize them and
                    discuss how it can be fixed. A short email giving a gist of everything must be sent to the team.
                    <br>
                    For fixing a problem one should tweak, not redesign and removing something away which is not
                    observed or not required.
