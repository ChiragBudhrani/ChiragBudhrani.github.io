                <h1>Find Usability Problems</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    Usability testing is observing people use your website which one is creating, with the intention to
                    find out that website is easier to use and make it easier to use.

                </div>
            </div>

            <div id="2">
                <h1>Do it Yourself Usability Testing</h1>
                <div>
                    This method is qualitative. The aim of this method is not to prove anything, but just to get
                    insights on the website. Which enables one to improve it.
                    One benefit of this is that it is informal and the protocol can be changed at mid-test.<br>
                    A facilitator always sits with the participant, gives him some task, and encourages one to think out
                    loud. Interested people like a member of development team, stakeholders observe the participant from
                    another room, using screen sharing software.
                    After test session, a debriefing is conducted where they decide what problems should be fixed.<br>

                    Every usability test is useful because every site has problems, most of the problems are easy to
                    find and it gives satisfaction to see someone use what one is designing.
                    <br>
                    A usability test is effective yet many organizations do not conduct it because of reasons like most
                    people still have not had any experience in usability testing, lack of time, and unwillingness to
                    show one's work before it is completed.
                    <br>
                    People avoid usability testing because they think of it as some big production which is referred as
                    Big Honkin' test by the author.
                    <br>
                    The author provides a plan to conduct usability testing once every month and to recruit only three
                    participants and observe them and as testing is done one can move to debriefing and this way in half
                    of the day usability test can be conducted and rest of the month can be spent on correcting only the
                    serious problems.
                    <br>
                    Do it yourself in Agile: There are short cycles in agile methodology. So author suggests conducting
                    a morning a sprint. One can recruit less amount of participants for this and can ask them to test it
                    remotely.
                    <br>
                    Approx budget: Approx budget for " Do it Yourself Usability Testing " is $4000-$6000. Which includes
                    expense for the microphone, screen sharing software, screen recording, and incentives.

                <hr>
                <div>
                    It is good to conduct a test on competitive websites by giving participants task which is given to
                    test one's website. In debriefing team should discuss what features can be applied to own project
                    and what worked well and what not

                <h1>Sketch on the napkin</h1>
                <hr>
                <div>
                    When one designs a website one draws some sketch on a piece of paper roughly, and one can ask
                    participants what they understand by showing that rough sketch. This rough sketch is termed by the
                    author as "Sketch on the napkin".

                <hr>
                <div>
                    Wireframes are a schematic diagram of the web page. Testing wireframe can be asking questions about
                    the diagram and finding out what comes on the mid of user when he first views the design and it
                    gives a brief idea of what user expects from the layout and elements.
                    It gives a good idea about the categorization of elements and their naming convention. As it is not
                    time-consuming it should be conducted by testing competitive site.

                    design.

            <div id="7">
                <h1>Recruiting Participants</h1>
                <div>
                    It is not necessary that the participants for testing are from the target audience. Specifically for
                    the initial stages. At the end stages also there must be at least one user who is not from the
                    target audience. By this one can find out that what a person will understand seeing the final
                    product at the end stage and how one will react. By this, it will be evident if the site is usable
                    or not.
                    <br>
                    The author advises that there should be 3 participants for usability testing. One benefit is that
                    main problems with the website will be evident by three users. It is also easy to find three
                    participants and one can have more rounds of testing. One easy way is to hire a recruiter but it
                    will surely cost a good amount of money.

                <h1>Recruiting Substitute</h1>
                <div>
When a participant does not show up a substitute must be available. A substitute can be any person who is from the other department of the company or a person who is from the other company.
<br>
                    A substitute can also be an actual user who can test the website remotely or in person. If the actual user is testing remotely one should be connected constantly till the testing session is completed.
